**Building multimodal embodied intelligence adapted to the physical world.** 

---

## 📖 Overview
We are developing algorithms that allow robots to understand ambiguous natural language instructions and perform complex tasks in the real world.

## 🎬 Demo Highlight
### The Duck Exchange Challenge 🦆
We have implemented a demonstration showcasing precise object manipulation:
*   **Task:** Exchange positions of red and blue duck dolls.
*   **Capabilities:** Object detection, grasping, and spatial reasoning.

> 🔴 **Red Duck** <---> **Blue Duck** 🔵

## ⚠️ Note
**Work in Progress**
The code is continuously being updated. Features and APIs may change as we refine the models.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
